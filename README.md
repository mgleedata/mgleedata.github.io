- Led a randomized controlled trial with 107 high school freshmen to assess the effects of gratitude journaling on happiness and well-being, using the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire and additional gratitude measures.
- Designed and implemented surveys, blocking participants by gender, race, and class performance to ensure balanced randomization.
- Performed OLS regression with robust standard errors to evaluate the impact of journaling on final happiness and gratitude scores.

##### Wikepedia Clustering with K-means
- Developed a K-means culturing model to categorize Wikipedia articles based on their sematic and content similaries, aiming to improve the browesing experience by suggesting articles without restricting topics.
- Web-scraped Wikipedia articles and processed the text by tokenizing and embedding for semantic meaning.
- Tested multiple cluster sizes (64, 31, 8, 4) using the Elbow Method to determine optimal groupings.
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (to reduce dimensionality and improve clustering results.

##### Time Series Analysis of Evolution of CO2 Levels from 1997 to Present
- Analyzed long-term atmospheric CO2 data from the Mauna Loa Observatory to predict future CO2 concentrations using linear, quadratic, and ARIMA models, focusing on the impact of seasonality and human activities on CO2 trends.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on historical CO2 data to identify trends, seasonality, and autocorrelations.
- Developed and compared ARIMA and polynomial regression models to forecast future CO2 levels.
- Performed residual analysis and KPSS tests to ensure stationarity and evaluate model performance.

##### Bike Share Demand in Seoul, South Korea
- Developed a Poisson regression model to predict bike rental demand using the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand dataset, analyzing environmental and temporal factors influencing hourly bike rentals.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on key features like temperature, wind speed, and seasonality.
- Built and compared multiple Poisson regression models to assess the influence of factors such as temperature, hour, wind speed, and seasonality.
- Applied negative binomial regression to address overdispersion and improve model accuracy.

##### Optimizing Delivery with BART and Cloud Algorithms
- Developed an optimized delivery system using BART public transit and cloud-based technologies (Neo4j, MongoDB, Redis) to enhance route planning and real-time tracking for AGM deliveries.
- Neo4j: Applied Louvain modularity, closeness centrality, and Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize delivery routes and staging locations using BART stations
- MongoDB: Utilized geospatial indexing for aerial delivery route planning and tracking, storing customer orders with real-time updates
- Redis: Enabled real-time tracking of drones and live inventory management with ultra-fast data processing.

##### The Road to Efficiency: Exploring the Dynamics of MPG in 1985 Cars
- Analyzed the relationship between vehicle weight and fuel efficiency using a dataset from the 1985 Ward’s Automotive Yearbook. The project aimed to understand how factors like horsepower, fuel system, and vehicle origin affect fuel efficiency, particularly for older vehicle models.
- Preprocessed a dataset of 192 vehicles, handling missing values and collinearity issues by creating derived features.
- Developed three linear regression models and evaluated them using diagnostic plots, such as residuals vs. fitted values, and conducted Breusch-Pagan and Shapiro-Wilk tests to confirm model assumptions for constant variance and normality of errors.
- Applied a Box-Cox transformation to the response variable in Model 3 to address issues of heteroscedasticity and non-normality in the residuals.]

##### Analyzing the Impact of Stricter Voting Laws on Party-Specific Voter Accessibility
- Conducted an analysis to assess whether Democratic or Republican voters experienced more difficulty voting after the stricter voting laws enacted following the 2020 U.S. election. Utilized data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) to investigate the impact of these laws on voting challenges.
- Analyzed data from 1,585 respondents in a 2022 YouGov pilot survey, categorizing participants based on party affiliation using their voting behavior in the 2020 and 2022 elections.
- Employed statistical techniques, including the Mann-Whitney U Test, to compare ordinal data on voting difficulty across party lines and addressed potential biases by excluding "Other" affiliations and ensuring identical distribution assumptions for the analysis.
- Visualized voting difficulty distributions for both Democrats and Republicans using bar charts.

##### A Dive into the True Nature of UFO Sightings vs. Near-Earth Object
- Conducted a data-driven analysis to investigate potential correlations between UFO sightings and near-Earth objects (NEOs). Collaborated to compare UFO reports from the National UFO Reporting Center with NEO data from NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.
