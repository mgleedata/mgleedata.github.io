### Projects 
Detecting Illegal Cannabis Cultivations in NorCal National Forests.
- Developed a machine learning solution to identify deforestation and predict illegal cannabis cultivation sites using satellite imagery and geospatial analysis, focusing on environmental conservation and efficient detection in dense forest regions
•	Implemented UNET Transformer models for 2D image segmentation, achieving high recall in forest cover detection from satellite imagery.
•	Analyzed water proximity and land slope to predict potential illegal cultivation sites, enhancing environmental monitoring efficiency. 

Panel Models of US Traffic Fatalities: 1980 - 2004
- Explored the relationship between traffic law changes and traffic fatalities across 48 U.S. States using 25 years of data from Fatality Analysis Reporting system using panel data.
•	Developed linear and expanded regression models to evaluate the impact of traffic laws on fatality rate.
•	Estimated both fixed and random effect models, applying panel data techniques to control for unobserved, state specific characteristics.

The Impact of Gratitude Journaling on High School Freshman Happiness
- Led a randomized controlled trial with 107 high school freshmen to assess the effects of gratitude journaling on happiness and well-being, using the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire and additional gratitude measures.
•	Designed and implemented surveys, blocking participants by gender, race, and class performance to ensure balanced randomization.
•	Performed OLS regression with robust standard errors to evaluate the impact of journaling on final happiness and gratitude scores.

Time Series Analysis of Evolution of CO2 Levels from 1997 to Present
- Analyzed long-term atmospheric CO2 data from the Mauna Loa Observatory to predict future CO2 concentrations using linear, quadratic, and ARIMA models, focusing on the impact of seasonality and human activities on CO2 trends.
•	Conducted exploratory data analysis on historical CO2 data to identify trends, seasonality, and autocorrelations.
•	Developed and compared ARIMA and polynomial regression models to forecast future CO2 levels.
•	Performed residual analysis and KPSS tests to ensure stationarity and evaluate model performance.

Optimizing Delivery with BART and Cloud Algorithms
- Developed an optimized delivery system using BART public transit and cloud-based technologies (Neo4j, MongoDB, Redis) to enhance route planning and real-time tracking for AGM deliveries.
•	Neo4j: Applied Louvain modularity, closeness centrality, and Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize delivery routes and staging locations using BART stations.
•	MongoDB: Utilized geospatial indexing for aerial delivery route planning and tracking, storing customer orders with real-time updates.
•	Redis: Enabled real-time tracking of drones and live inventory management with ultra-fast data processing.
